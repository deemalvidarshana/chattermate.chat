Runtime enforcement for the global chat guardrails.

Two checks around every LLM call on visitor text:
- check_inbound: strong-signal injection detection BEFORE inference. Blocking
  is governed by GUARDRAIL_INBOUND_ACTION ("off" / "template_only" / "strict");
  non-blocking hits are still counted, which is the data that gates ever
  turning "strict" on.
- check_output: scans the reply for leaked policy text (replace + record) and
  for the model's own scope refusal (record only) — the only place scope
  declines become measurable, since chat messages are encrypted at rest.

Every entry point here FAILS OPEN: a guardrail bug must degrade to
"no guardrail", never to "no chat".
